# Genome-Pattern-Analysis-Toolkit
Beginner friendly bioinformatics toolkit for genomic pattern analysis, including pattern count, pattern matching, and k-mer analysis algorithms

## Algorithms Included

- **PatternCount:** counts the occurence of a given pattern or kmer in the provided genome or DNA sequence
- **PatternMatching:** returns us the list which will include all the initial positions of the requred kmer from the provided genome or DNA sequence
- **FrequencyMap:** generates a dictionary with all the possible kmers from the genome as a key and their number of occurence as their values
- **FrequentWords:** to indentify the most frequent kmers
- **ReverseComplement:** computes reverse complement of the given genome
